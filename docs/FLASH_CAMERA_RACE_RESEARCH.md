## Bug Summary

**Platform:** Realtek RTL8735B (AmebaPro2) / ideasHatch HUB-8735 / 安信可 BW21-CBV  
**Trigger:** Any SPI flash page program or sector erase operation causes VOE camera failure on the **next cold boot**.

**Symptom severity ladder:**

| Flash operations | Next cold boot result |
|---|---|
| 0 writes | Always OK |
| 1× `flash_write_word` (4 bytes, no erase) | Stable |
| 70× `flash_write_word` (280 bytes, no erase) | `[VOE][WARN]slot full` deadlock (mild) |
| Any sector erase | `VOE_OPEN_CMD fail` + `hal_video_open fail` (complete) |

**Boot ROM message (always present after write):**
```
FCS KM_status 0x00002081 err 0x0000200a
It don't do the sensor initial process
```

**Normal working FCS boot (reference from GitHub Issue #251):**
```
FCS KM_status 0x00000082  err 0x00000000
FCS TM_status 0x00000001
Sensor: 254µs  IQ: 4587µs  ITCM: 1011µs  DTCM: 51µs
DDR: 11957µs  DDR2: 11310µs
VOE flash @ 0x807e080  size 0x7ff80
FCS OK
```

## Key Confirmed Facts

- **FCS data address**: `fcsdata` partition = 0x8000 (boot ROM reads here); `NOR_FLASH_FCS` = 0xF0D000 (runtime AE/AWB)
- **FlashMemory address**: 0xFD0000–0xFFFFFF (no direct overlap with FCS)
- **Root cause mechanism**: INDIRECT — still unknown; address overlap disproved (Finding 13)
- **Postbuild tool**: `build.fcs_mode_val` controls whether `fcs_data_<sensor>.bin` is uploaded to fcsdata partition
- **`Arduino_FCS_MODE`**: Defined in boards.txt but NOT passed to C++ compiler (Finding 111)
- **KM error codes decoded** (Finding 116):
  - `KM_status 0x00002081` = `FCS_RUN_DATA_NG_KM` (FCS ran, data Not Good)
  - `err 0x0000200a` = `FCS_I2C_INIT_ERR` (I2C init failed during FCS sensor boot)
  - Normal working boot: `KM_status 0x00000082` = `FCS_RUN_DATA_OK_KM`
- **KM hardware registers**: `KM_STATUS = 0x40492004`, `KM_FCS_ERROR_REG = 0x40492008`
- **FCS_BYPASS_WHILE1_KM = 0x0083**: KM bypass/while(1) state; likely maps to "[VOE][WARN]slot full" mild case
- **"It don't do the sensor initial process"**: Boot ROM does NOT fall back to normal sensor init when FCS fails; camera sensor is left completely uninitialized
- **No public fix**: Bug is undocumented and unpatched as of 2026-05-13

## Research Update — 2026-05-13 (Cycle U3)

**Key new finding this cycle:** The exact boot ROM error codes are now decoded from
`rtl8735b_voe_status.h` in the ameba-rtos-pro2 SDK.

| Source | Key Finding | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| `rtl8735b_voe_status.h` | `KM_status 0x2081` = `FCS_RUN_DATA_NG_KM`; `err 0x200A` = `FCS_I2C_INIT_ERR` — KM co-processor failed to init I2C during FCS sensor boot | HIGH |
| `rtl8735b_voe_status.h` | KM registers: `KM_STATUS=0x40492004`, `KM_FCS_ERROR_REG=0x40492008`; `FCS_BYPASS_WHILE1_KM=0x0083` maps to "slot full" deadlock | HIGH |
| `hal_video_common.h` | `fcs` field: "1: fcs flow ROM load sensor, 0: normal flow need init sensor" — confirms boot ROM does NOT fall back when FCS fails | MEDIUM |
| `hal_video_release_note.txt` | VOE 1.5.6.0 (Jul 2024): "Reinit GPIO in FCS mode" — FCS has known GPIO init sensitivities; predates FlashMemory; no flash mutex fix | LOW |
| Zephyr issue #51713 | SPI NOR WIP-bit during cold boot causes flash reads to fail (returns 0x00) — cross-platform precedent for flash-busy-at-boot failure class | MEDIUM |
| ameba-arduino-pro2 releases | V4.1.1-QC-V03 (Apr 17) and QC-V04 (Apr 2) documented; no FCS/flash fix in any V4.1.1 pre-release; no stable V4.1.1 yet | LOW |

**No confirmed fix. Bug remains unpatched.**
